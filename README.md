a screenshot showing why it is important to take your time when grading your peers on Coursera

(Already reported the issue to Coursera, but want to point it out to all of you before you grade someone else's assignment.)
What is the issue?
When grading the 25 point final in week 4 (the Data Tools and Ecosystem assignment), questions 4, 5, and 10 all show the 3 point maximum grade up above and separate from the radio buttons to select 2 points, 1 point, or 0 points.  This means that if you review someone else's assignment and meant to give them the maximum points for each section being fully complete per the instructions, and you don't notice the max 3 pointer is up above, you may accidentally only give them 2 points.  This could mean the difference between passing and failing the assignment for someone.

Confused?  See this screenshot.


Does it matter if they still passed?
Do the points earned on a final matter if you pass it anyway?  Yes!  On the course completion certificate, it shows a verification link and that website shows the score you achieved.  We all likely would prefer to have a potential employer see that we scored as high as we actually did and not a lower number based on a keying error.
